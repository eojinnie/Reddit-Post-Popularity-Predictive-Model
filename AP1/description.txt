In this project, we aim to identify and evaluate factors that contribute to the popularity of self-posts on Reddit. Our main category of focus will be on the title of each self-post. We aim to create specific guidelines and criteria for titles that lead to a high number of upvotes; these annotation guidelines include a variety of factors, including the types of words used in the title, the length of the title, the presence of special characters, the frequency of uppercase letters, and others.

To support our analysis, we will utilize a dataset consisting of 1,013,000 self-posts from 1013 different subreddits (1000 examples per class). To further increase the accuracy of our results, we will perform another simple random sampling from the dataset, which will help us ensure that our findings are representative of the entire dataset and are not biased towards a particular subset of the data. The method for this random sampling will be selected at a later stage, when we begin working on Ap2. This dataset includes four columns of information for each post: post id, subreddit, title of the self-post, and text content of the post. All of the information for each self-post, including the title and content, have been gathered from the respective subreddit.

Data used in this project is openly available and can be freely shared without any restrictions because the data is not subject to any privacy regulations or protected by copyright laws. The openness and accessibility of the data make Reddit an ideal data resource for our research into the popularity of self-posts on Reddit. By leveraging this resource, we hope to gain a understanding of the factors that contribute to the popularity of self-posts and provide valuable insights that enhance our understanding of human psychology behind social media posts.
